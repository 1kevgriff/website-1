## Bio
I am a senior at Florida International University pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I am originally from Venezuela, and arrived to the U.S. in 2015.
I am passionate about problem solving and automation for social improvement. I have been researching and learning new AI and Machine Learning techniques in hopes of using it to encourage social development for the past two years. 
Outside of tech, my hobby is cooking! I love experimenting with new ingredients and trying new cuisines. I am also a big futbol fan, hoping my country will finally make it to a World Cup.
