## Bio
I lead Developer Relations for the cloud at Microsoft, leading the team reinventing Microsoft's relationship with software developers around the globe.  Our team is maniacal about making the world amazing for developers of all backgrounds.

We're excited to support and contribute to open source platforms, tools, and processes. As Developer Advocates, we're spreading awareness of Azure and enabling developers to do what they love; write, code, and learn. Great online content (docs, demos, videos, code) is the foundation of everything we do.

We create global developer online experiences for Microsoft like docs.microsoft.com, Channel 9, and dev.microsoft.com. We connect with developer communities through our programs including Microsoft MVP, Microsoft Regional Director, our annual Build conference and third-party developer events around the globe.
