## .NET Foundation Election 2020 Nominations are Open!

As described in my [last post](/blog/2020/06/08/announcing-net-foundation-elections-2020), the board has selected a nomination committee and [opened up nominations](/about/election/campaign). The nomination committee is:

- Julie Lerman
- Jessica White
- Steve (Ardalis) Smith
- Iris Classon
- Rabeb Othmani

They will review each nomination for the following criteria:

- Active voting member of the Foundation in good standing
- Prior leadership role within the .NET Foundation (e.g., Board Director, Project Leader, Committee chair, etc.)
- Leadership role within another open source software foundation (e.g., Board Director, Project Leader, Committee chair, etc.)
- Recent active involvement in the .NET Foundation
- A commitment to dedicate up to ten hours per month on Board responsibilities

While .NET and programming are highly technical things, the board of the .NET Foundation isn't a technical role. We need people who can organize, lead programs, create change, and bring their experiences to define and execute the .NET Foundation's mission. If that sounds like you, [please nominate yourself](/about/election/campaign) today!  Nominations are open and will close on June 26th. The slate of candidates will be announced on July 7th, beginning a two week campaign period. Elections follow for two weeks using the [same system](https://www.opavote.com/methods/single-transferable-vote) as last year.
