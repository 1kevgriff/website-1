# Promoting and Studying Diversity and Inclusion in .NET Open Source

An important goal of the .NET Foundation is to promote diversty and inclusion within the .NET community and OSS ecosystem. To that end, we've set upon the following goals:

## Short Term

* Gather scientific data to diagnose current status of Diversity and Inclusion within the .NET Foundation and its projects.
* Raise awareness in our community about the importance of Diversity & Inclusion in the business, and in the open source industry.
* Have a measurable list of key indicators to track over time.

## Medium Term

* Instrument the .NET Foundation contributor funnel to establish a participation baseline for underrepresented groups.
* Create a toolkit to address the top 3 entry barriers for new contributors from under represented groups.
* Be the trusted, go-to partner for action groups when it comes to D&I.

## Long Term

* Have committer on-boarding and retention plans, built with and agreed with the action groups.
* Improve the quality of .NET Foundation projects by increasing participation of at least one underrepresented group by 20% across all .NET Foundation projects.
