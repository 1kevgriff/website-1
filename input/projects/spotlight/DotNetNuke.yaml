projectDescription: |
  The DNN Platform is a Content Management System (CMS) based on Microsoft's .NET Framework.
  Just like other CMSs such as Wordpress, Joomla or Drupal, it allows users to create and manage
  online content. And just like those other CMSs you can extend the application with custom
  addons to suit your needs. Unlike most other CMSs, however, it is built on .NET,
  meaning it is built on a solid foundation created by the world's most successful tech company.
  Microsoft invests heavily to ensure this is the most powerful and secure backbone for web-based
  applications. To date, DNN is the most succesful open source CMS built on this enterprise-grade infrastructure.
